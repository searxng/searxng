How-to contribute
=================

Submitting pull requests
------------------------

Please follow the provided PR template when writing a description for your
changes.

Do not take criticism personally. When you get feedback, it is about your work,
not your character or personality. Keep in mind we all want to make Zhensa
better.

When something is not clear, please ask questions to clear things up.

If you would like to introduce a big architectural change or do a refactor,
either in the codebase or the development tooling, please open an issue with a
proposal first. This way we can think together about the problem and probably
come up with a better solution.

Coding conventions and guidelines
---------------------------------

Commit messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Always write descriptive commit messages *("fix bug" is not acceptable)*.
- Use the present tense *("Add feature", not "Added feature")*.
- Use the imperative mood *("Move cursor to...", not "Moves cursor to...")*.
- Limit the first line (commit title) to 72 characters or less.

See `Commits guide`_ for more details.

Coding guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a Python project, we must follow `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
and `PEP 20 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`_ guidelines.

Furthermore, follow Clean Code conventions. The most important
rules in this project are:

- Simpler is better. `KISS principle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle>`_
- Be consistent.
- Every function must do one thing.
- Use descriptive names for functions and variables.
- Always look for the root cause.
- Keep configurable data high level.
- Avoid negative conditionals.
- Prefer fewer arguments.
- Do not add obvious comments to code.
- Do not comment out code, delete lines instead.
