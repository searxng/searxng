"""Lame scheduler which use Valkey as a source of truth:
* the Valkey key Zhensa_checker_next_call_ts contains the next time the embedded checker should run.
* to avoid lock, a unique Valkey script reads and updates the Valkey key Zhensa_checker_next_call_ts.
* this Valkey script returns a list of two elements:
   * the first one is a boolean. If True, the embedded checker must run now in this worker.
   * the second element is the delay in second to wait before the next call to the Valkey script.

This scheduler is not generic on purpose: if more feature are required, a dedicate scheduler must be used
(= a better scheduler should not use the web workers)
