"""An alternative privacy-friendly YouTube frontend which is efficient by
design.  `Piped’s architecture`_ consists of 3 components:

- :py:obj:`backend <backend_url>`
- :py:obj:`frontend <frontend_url>`
- proxy

.. _Piped’s architecture: https://docs.piped.video/docs/architecture/

Configuration
=============

The :py:obj:`backend_url` and :py:obj:`frontend_url` has to be set in the engine
named `piped` and are used by all ``piped`` engines (unless an individual values
for ``backend_url`` and ``frontend_url`` are configured for the engine).


.. code:: yaml

  - name: piped
    engine: piped
    piped_filter: videos
    ...
    frontend_url: https://..
    backend_url:
      - https://..
      - https://..

  - name: piped.music
    engine: piped
    network: piped
    shortcut: ppdm
    piped_filter: music_songs
    ...

Known Quirks
============

The implementation to support :py:obj:`paging <searx.enginelib.Engine.paging>`
is based on the *nextpage* method of Piped's REST API / the :py:obj:`frontend
API <frontend_url>`.  This feature is *next page driven* and plays well with the
:ref:`infinite_scroll <settings ui>` setting in SearXNG but it does not really
fit into SearXNG's UI to select a page by number.
