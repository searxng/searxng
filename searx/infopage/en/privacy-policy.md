# Privacy Policy

Last updated: April 7, 2023

## Who we are 

This web application/site is owned and operated by <a href="https://mkm.technology/" target="_blank">Moïse KM</a>. To learn more about Fufusoup visit the {{link('about', 'about')}} page. 

## Data

This web application has a built-in rate limiter plugin that will collect your IP address in a one-way hashed format. One-Way Hashing Format is a one-way encryption method that allows data to be encrypted, but not decrypted. This means that the application does not collect or store your real IP address, but only a one-way encrypted version of it so that it can detect IP addresses that behave maliciously and rate limit connections from them. Furthermore, the hashed IP addresses are stored in memory only, and are not used for any other purpose than rate limiting. A single hashed IP address is stored for a maximum of 10 minutes after the last request from it.

## Cookies

No cookies are used on this web application/site. However, your browser’s local storage is used to save your color scheme preference if you ever change it manually. Fufusoup can optionally use cookies to store settings if you choose to change them from the default {{link('settings/preferences', 'preferences')}}. Your {{link('settings/preferences', 'preferences')}} can alternatively be stored in a custom URL instead.


## Embedded third party content

Currently no third party content is embedded on this web application/site.

## Analytics

No analytics are used on this site. Fufusoup measures aggregate statistics on how upstream search engines perform, but this does not include any user data.

## Changes to this privacy policy

I reserve the right to update this privacy policy from time to time. I constantly keep it up to date with the latest changes. If this policy is changed substantially, I will put a clear notice on the front page for at least 7 days.
